# TDA-aided Graph Convolutional Networks for improved lung transplantation insights.
The lung transplant prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their lung transplant status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), heart diseases, bronchial conditions, preoperative diabetes, acute renal failure, pneumonia, etc. This dataset can be utilized to build machine learning models to predict the one-year mortality risk after lung transplantation based on patients' medical histories and demographic information. Healthcare professionals can use this information to identify patients at risk of lung transplantation and develop personalized treatment plans. Additionally, researchers can use the dataset to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing lung transplantation.
